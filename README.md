This Go program takes a string as an argument and outputs it in a the form of ASCII art.  
It handles input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters, and newline characters.  
Check [standard.txt](.idea/standard.txt) file for the used ASCII art representations.  

## Usage

- Open your terminal.  
- Run the following command:

## About ASCII standard
ASCII is a character encoding standard used for representing text in computers and communication equipment. ASCII defines a set of 128 characters,  
including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, control characters (such as newline and tab), and non-printable characters.  
Each character in ASCII is represented by a 7-bit binary number (0-127), which allows for 128 unique characters. The ASCII standard was first  
published in 1963 and has since become widely adopted as the de facto standard for character encoding in computing systems. ASCII characters are used  
to represent text in various applications, including text files, programming languages, communication protocols, and user interfaces. While ASCII is  
limited to representing characters from the English alphabet and some common symbols, it remains a fundamental encoding standard in computer systems.
